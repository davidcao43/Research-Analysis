## Week 2 Progress Update: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Housing Price Data

This week, I focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the housing price dataset (`Metro_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month.csv`). The main steps and progress are as follows:

- Imported essential libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.
- Loaded the housing price data into a pandas DataFrame and inspected its structure, including column names and data types.
- Checked for and addressed missing values to ensure data quality.
- Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of housing prices.
- Visualized price trends over time for selected metro areas using time series plots.
- Explored the distribution of housing prices across all metros with histograms and boxplots.
- Analyzed average prices by metro area and compared trends among top metros.
- Conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between housing prices and other numerical features.

The EDA notebook is organized and ready for further analysis or modeling. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for additional analyses.
